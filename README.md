C++ adapter to translate between a front end application and simulations of varying types. Currently integrates the Bullet3 physics engine and AirSim.

For this to work, you must pull, compile and install the bullet 3 physics engine from the bullet repository. 

Install steps must also be followed for AirSim 

Goal is for this adapter to be compatible with multiple simulation engines.
